# CyberCart POS - JavaEE Backend
A CyberCart (Point of Sale) application is a versatile online tool that empowers businesses to efficiently handle their sales transactions. This intuitive software operates through a web browser, providing a seamless experience for managing orders, items and maintaining a centralized system for customer information. This project serves as an educational resource to enhance understanding of Java EE development.
## Project Components
### Front-end
The front-end of a website or application is the user interface that users interact with. It includes the design, layout, and features visible to the user, providing a seamless and visually appealing experience. The front-end uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX to create a dynamic and responsive web application.
### Back-end
The backend is the behind-the-scenes technology responsible for server-side and data management operations. It includes databases, server logic, and application architecture, handling tasks such as data processing, server communication, and business logic. The back-end of the POS system is implemented using JavaEE and is configured to run on the Apache Tomcat server.
### Features
